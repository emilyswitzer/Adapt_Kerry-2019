           <h2>What is Domestic Abuse?</h2>
           <h4><span class="lightpurple">Coercive Control</span></h4>
             <p>Domestic abuse isn't always physical. Coercive control is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.</p>
             <p>This controlling behaviour is designed to make a person dependent by isolating them from support, exploiting them, depriving them of independence and regulating their everyday behaviour.</p>
             <p>Coercive control creates invisible chains and a sense of fear that pervades all elements of a victim's life. It works to limit their human rights by depriving them of their liberty and reducing their ability for action. Experts like Evan Stark 
             liken coercive control to being taken hostage. As he says: "the victim becomes captive in an unreal world created by the abuser, entrapped in a world of confusion, contradiction and fear."</p>
            <h4><span class="lightpurple">How do you know if this is happening to you?</span></h4>
             <p>Some common examples of coercive behaviour are:
             <ul>
             <li>Isolating you from friends and family.</li>
             <li>Depriving you of basic needs, such as food.</li>
             <li>Monitoring your time.</li>
             <li>Monitoring you via online communication tools or spyware.</li>
             <li>Taking control over aspects of your everyday life, such as where you can go, who you can see, what you can wear and when you can sleep.</li>
             <li>Depriving you access to support services, such as medical services</li>
             <li>Repeatedly putting you down, such as saying you're worthless</li>
             <li>Humiliating, degrading or dehumanising you</li>
             <li>Controlling your finances</li>
             <li>Making threats or intimidating you</li>
             </ul>
           </p>
            <h4><span class="lightpurple">Gaslighting</span> </h4>
           <p><span class="italics">"Oh come on. I never said that."</p>
           <p>"You're just being overly sensitive."</p>
           <p>"I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this..."</span></p>
           <p>Psychologists use the term "gaslighting" to refer to a specific type of manipulation where the manipulator is trying to get someone else (or a group of people) to
            question their own reality, memory or perceptions.  Gaslighting is experienced by women who are manipulated by their abuser into questioning and doubting their own 
            sanity, perceptions and memory. </p>
