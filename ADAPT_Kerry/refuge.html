           <h2>Refuge Service</h2>
            <p>When you come to Refuge for the first time, you will be met with a support worker, who will listen and support you through admission to the Refuge.  We know that it is not easy to have to leave your home and seek the support of the Refuge and we endeavour to make you as welcome and comfortable as possible while supporting you through this difficult time.  </p>
            <p>Our aim is to help you as a woman, to work towards your own goals and we know that you may need time to reflect, and to think about your plans while remaining safe in Refuge.  We believe that all people, regardless of age, race, class, education, religion or sexual orientation have the right to a non&minus;violent life.</p>  
            <p>We also recognise that sometimes, that your sole need from our service maybe a period of respite and we respect your wishes in this.</p>  
            <p>We offer six self-contained apartments which include your own kitchen/living room, bedroom and your own bathroom.  All our apartments are fully fitted with the necessary appliances needed for everyday living. </p>
            <p>If you do not have money on arrival, staff will support you in accessing financial support and we will ensure that neither you, or your children will go without while waiting for an income to be set up.  
               If you do not have clothes, shoes or other basic necessities, we will also ensure that you will be looked after from our provisions.  The Refuge is very well supported by the community and we receive regular support by donations of clothes, toiletries, etc.</p>
            <p>When in Refuge, you will have a Support Worker available to sit, listen and support you.  We, recognise that you have your own unique needs and wishes and we will try to support and facilitate your needs as best we can during your stay with us.  
               We provide a range of information on finance, housing, children, court orders and social welfare. </p>

            <h4> ChildCare </h4>
              <p>In Refuge, we have a playroom which is available to you and your children during your stay.  We appreciate that it is not only difficult for you but also your children to transition into life in Refuge.  We have a dedicated Child Care worker who will support both you and your children around this, often confusing and emotional time.  We have a playroom with many different activities and toys to help the children to settle in and entertain them during the day.  </p>
